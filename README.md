Project Overview 
- Stage 1 of Popular Movies Project
- In this project, I build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. 
- In this stage you’ll build the core experience of your movies app.

App will:
- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
-  Allow your user to change sort order via a setting: The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated.
-  Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as: original title movie poster image thumbnail A plot synopsis (called overview in the api) user rating (called vote_average in the api) release date.

Adding your API_KEY to the Application
- Please add your API_KEY in the file secrets.properties in the project main path
  
How to get API_KEY
- To fetch popular movies, you will use the API from themoviedb.org.
- If you don’t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.
- In your request for a key, state that your usage will be for educational/non-commercial use. You will also need to provide some personal information to complete the request. Once you submit your request, you should receive your key via email shortly after.
